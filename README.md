## Introduction:

The healthcare system in Nigeria is facing a critical shortage of neurological surgeons, placing immense pressure on the existing workforce. This shortage is particularly alarming given the rising prevalence of brain tumors, which require timely and precise diagnosis. In an environment where every second counts, the integration of machine learning (ML) models into medical practice can provide a much-needed respite. By automating the classification of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we can significantly reduce the workload of surgeons. This technology not only speeds up the diagnostic process but also ensures accuracy, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on patient care and complex surgical interventions. This report explores the development and application of a CNN model designed to aid in the classification of brain tumors, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and alleviate the burden on Nigeria's healthcare system.

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop and deploy a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of brain tumors. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate, rapid, and automated diagnosis of brain tumors, thereby alleviating the workload of neurological surgeons in Nigeria. This initiative seeks to improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment, addressing the critical shortage of specialists, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.e.

## Data Sources:

The dataset for this project was sourced from a comprehensive brain tumor repository on Kaggle. This dataset includes detailed images of various types of brain tumors, providing a robust foundation for training and validating the Convolutional Neural Network model. Utilizing this well-curated dataset ensures the reliability and accuracy of the machine learning model, as it encompasses a diverse array of tumor images necessary for effective classification.

## Summary:

The model attained a precision and recall score of 0.9 each, along with an accuracy of 0.9.
